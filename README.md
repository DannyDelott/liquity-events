## What is Liquity?
[Liquity](https://docs.liquity.org/) is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw interest-free loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD (a USD pegged stablecoin).

## What is the LQTY Staking Pool?
Liquity captures the revenue from the [borrowing and redemption fees](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/general#does-liquity-charge-any-fees) and pays it out on a pro rata basis to the stakers of the LQTY token. The tokens can be staked and unstaked any time with no minimum lockup period.

## What is Liquity Events?
A frontend that shows realtime and historical information about the LQTY Staking Pool.
